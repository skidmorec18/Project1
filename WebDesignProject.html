        <h1><center> Why Mr. Brindley is my favorite!!! </center> </h1>
        
        <p> Mr. Brindley actually allowed me to enjoy technology. Before I had Intro to Tech, I hated computers! After taking that class I was convinced to take Weg Design; but then I heard that he was leaving...Anyway, Mr. Brindley tells a lot of funny jokes and creates a learning yet entertaining class enviorment, and he is a straight up person, and doesn't make you feel bad if do something a tad stupid! </p>

        <p> Lowkey sad that T-Brins is leaving, but he would be breaking his own policy, which is to LIVE THE DREAM. Its hard to describe the complex being of T-Brins, but these classes were worth my time. Live the Dream y'all. And visit Cat Skidmore at Texas Roadhouse in Westland!!!</p>
